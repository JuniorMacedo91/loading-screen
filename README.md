# loading-screen

## Description:
In this little project I decided to create a loading screen to learn more about animation techniques and how to use keyframes to give some effects.

## Techniques:

 - [x] Animation: ease-in-out, infinite : It shows an effect with a slow movement in the start and end.
 - [x] Keyframes - it creates animations gradually. The best way of using it is define with 0% and 100%.

## Project:
